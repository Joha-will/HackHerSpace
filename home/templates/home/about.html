            Welcome to <span class="text-pink-400 font-bold">HackHer Space</span> â€“ a community built by and for women in technology.
            Since the early **1990s**, we have been paving the way for **female coders, designers, and engineers** to break barriers in tech.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-200">
            In a world dominated by dial-up connections and CRT monitors, we knew that the future belonged to **women who code, create, and innovate**.
            From **C++ pioneers** to **early web developers**, our network has supported thousands of women in **finding their place in the tech world**.
