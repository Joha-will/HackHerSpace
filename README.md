### Project Goals
HackHerSpace is a project by 5Stars Team with the primary goal of uplifting, supporting, and inspiring women in coding and STEM fields. 5Stars Team aims to create a welcoming and inclusive community where women of all ages, backgrounds, and experiences can pursue their dreams in the tech industry.

### Design:

#### Colours/Fonts
Our team didn‚Äôt initially agree on a specific design for our website. A Windows 95-inspired look was suggested, with a grey navbar and footer, similar to the status bar in Windows 95, featuring a shadow box effect. However, things took their own course, and we ended up with a charming mix‚Äîsomething reminiscent of the wild west of 90s web design, when there were no strict rules. Early 2000s newspaper and university websites were also suggested as inspiration, and the homepage was designed based on one of these sites.

Fonts weren‚Äôt agreed upon either, so I‚Äôm just as curious about the final result as anyone else! The same goes for wireframes‚Äîalthough some sketches with design suggestions did appear by day two. üòä

## ![favicon](static/assets/favicon/favicon-16x16.png) Features

#### Navbar

Each page features the same navbar, designed in a 90s-inspired style‚Äîgrey with black text. The buttons in the navbar are centred, and there are seven links leading to different pages.

#### Footer

Every page also shares a minimalist footer, which contains only a simple copyright notice for a clean and consistent look.

#### Home

The homepage, also designed in a 90s-inspired style, is divided into three sections.

At the centre is the most important part, featuring a leading text explaining what HackHer Space is and its core principles. Below this, there's a 90s-era image of a woman drinking coffee in front of a computer.

On both sides, there are sidebars with links that lead nowhere‚Äîpurely for aesthetic nostalgia.

#### About



#### Mentors

The Mentors page follows the same 90s-inspired style, featuring two sidebars.

In the central section, there are portraits of the available mentors, each accompanied by a short bio detailing their expertise and background.

#### Questions

The Q&A page is divided into two sections.

On the left side, there are five topics to choose from: Python, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and Django. Clicking on a topic reveals a set of related questions.

On the right side, there is a form where users can select a topic (Python, JavaScript, etc.) and enter their question in a text area. Below, a "Submit Question" button allows users to send their queries.

#### History

The Women in Tech page showcases nine pioneering women selected by our team, ranging from Ada Lovelace and Frances Allen to our youngest heroine, Katie Bouman.

The profiles are arranged in a 3x3 grid, with each card featuring a portrait on a solid, colourful background. The original backgrounds were removed and replaced with warm tones to contrast with the grey 90s aesthetic.

When hovered over, each card reveals a quote from the featured woman. Below, a short bio highlights her contributions to technology.
