### Design:

#### Colours/Fonts
Our team didn‚Äôt initially agree on a specific design for our website. A Windows 95-inspired look was suggested, with a grey navbar and footer, similar to the status bar in Windows 95, featuring a shadow box effect. However, things took their own course, and we ended up with a charming mix‚Äîsomething reminiscent of the wild west of 90s web design, when there were no strict rules. Early 2000s newspaper and university websites were also suggested as inspiration, and the homepage was designed based on one of these sites.

Fonts weren‚Äôt agreed upon either, so I‚Äôm just as curious about the final result as anyone else! The same goes for wireframes‚Äîalthough some sketches with design suggestions did appear by day two. üòä
